BASELINES

.
The Intent of a Baseline is to Provide Information that Details our Solution(s) So That During the Proposal Development We are sellingnot Solving!

.
The Collection of Baseline Topics (Modules), Are a Collection Of Short Stories We Think We Will Have to Tell in Our Proposal

.
Our Baselines Become the Foundation for the Proposal Response

.
Our Proposal Response Must Reflect the Integration of Our:•
Technical approach

•
Functional integration

•
Programmatic Architecture

•
Organizational structure and responsibility








BASELINES

.
Our Team Must Understand and Own the Baselines 

.
Our Baselines Must Reflect Team Thinking

.
Our Baselines Must be Approved by Executive Management to Assure Stability

.
Baselines Provide a Common, Approved, Approach/Solution to its Respective Topic Area

.
Use of Baselines Provide a Consistent, Accurate, Compelling Base of Data to Answer an RFP Instruction/Requirement 




Proposal ‘ABCs’

.
Proposals are Scored not Read.
Follow the 7 Cs•
Compliant, Compelling, Credible, Correct, Consistent, Concise, & Clear







.
Customers Buy Benefits, not Features.
Use program knowledge to drive benefit

.
Show benefit of innovation to Users

.
Demonstrate improvement in service and delivery on existing contract(s) – PP & Proof Points

.
Become the ‘trusted advisor’, show/discuss benefit to the customer, not features – even at a cost to us




.
Proposals are Sales Documents, not Contracts.
Think outside the box, show thought leadership and innovation

.
Show how we support our Customer’s and their End User’s Mission







Title Page



Government Issues



Issues and Concerns

.
Customer’s issues and concerns

.
Our (Contractor’s) Issues and concerns

.
Must address both kinds effectively

.
These are the most important “secret” to crafting a winning story!



‘Smart’ Competitive Proposals Recognize the Key Issues And Concerns Around Requirements

When analyzing the requirements, dig deep to understand the drivers for the requirements – these become the real issues and concerns


The RFP Doesn’t Always Tell You What’s Bothering The Customer

What the RFP Said
“The Contractor Shall propose and innovative approach for…”
What the Customer Might Really Have Been Thinking

When analyzing the requirements, dig deep to understand the drivers for the requirements – these become the real issues and concerns


Customer’s Issues And Concerns

.
Is this a Key Requirement or “Nice-to-have”?

.
Critical problem or deficiency?

.
New opportunity or challenge?

.
Approval? Funding? Schedule?

.
Implementation issues?

.
Operational constraints?

.
Internal politics? Outside influences?

.
Organizational risk? Personal risk?

.
Are there agendas, biases, hot buttons?



What keeps the customer awake at night?

OK… So How Do I get to the real drivers … the real issues and concerns?

What drives this requirement from the Customer’s perspective?

Any unstated needs, worries, “history” to take into account?


Typical Unspoken Customer Issues and Concerns

What might your customer be concerned about, but can not acknowledge in the RFP?

Try reading ‘between the lines’ to develop the real issues and concerns


Do A Reality Check On “Customer Issues And Concerns”

What should worry you

 Because your Customer’s reaction might be

 
We’re just parroting the RFP

 “Do they understand our real problem?”

 
It’s not really a key issue to the Customer

 “Do they know what’s most important to us?”

 
Doesn’t show insight into our Customer’s true concerns

 “Do they know the right solution for us?”

 


Solution & Approach




Our Issues and Concerns

Why Should We Win?  How Could We Lose?

 
What should keep us awake at night?

 What should drive our response?

 
Are there shortfalls in our approach?

 Do we have any important issues (positive or negative) around our ability to meet this requirement?

 
Are there skeletons in our closet?

 Do we have a special strength, weakness vs. this requirement?

 
Are there personality issues?

 What must we do to win? Talk up, exploit strength? Ghost competitor…?

 
What must we do to avoid losing? Minimize a weakness? Remedy a deficiency? Overcome ‘bad press’…?

 



Typical Unspoken Issues and Concerns We May Have

.
Our management thinks we have accurate information about the customer and what they’re up to, … but we don’t

.
We ‘understand’ the issues and can probably do the work, but don’t have enough of a track record

.
We don’t currently have the right people , or can’t spring them from ongoing jobs

.
We don’t know if the customer is looking to switch contractors

.
????



What might we (our proposal team) be concerned about but are reluctant to tell our management?

Sample Ideas….


Do A Reality Check On “Our Issues And Concerns”

What should worry you

 Because ……

 
Playing it safe – “Got it covered”

 The competition might tell a more aggressive, persuasive story

 
Dancing around a vulnerability – not confronting and defusing it

 We’ll be giving away points we should be able to keep

 
Wishful thinking, not real discriminators

 Customer will figure that out too

 



Proof We Can Do This

Baselines Are at the Heart of the Proposal

.
Develop Facts and Assumptions “ the Foundation” Used to Prepare Proposal–Avoid the overpowering urge to start writing




.Driven by Win Strategy 

.Prepared by Core Team

.Identify Disconnects and Problems Early

.Sr. Management Approval Needed Before Authors Start to Write the Proposal

.Briefed to All Authors at Proposal Kick-off–Provide basis for authors to develop proposal






Why Do We Develop Baselines?


What To Expect From Baselines

.
We Started With a List of Topics Identified in the RFP.
Developed into baseline Modules




.
We Expanded The Baseline Modules After Requirements Analysis.
We added some new topics to the baselines

.
We refined existing baselines




.
Baseline Briefing Is Just a Collection of Information / Data.
Each Baseline has a list of topics addressed

.
The List of topics are in random order

.
Not intended to be a smooth story




.
When A Final RFP is Released.
Baseline topics will be used as information sources to jump start the proposal writing process




.
Presenting Answers to Questions presented in the RFP is Good Proposal Process.
Proposals are not read like a novel

.
Proposals are evaluated

.
At best, a volume is a collection of short (very short) stories
